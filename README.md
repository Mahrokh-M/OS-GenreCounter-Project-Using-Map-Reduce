# Operating Systems Course Project: GenreCounter

## Overview
This project, developed for the Operating Systems course, implements a command-line program called `GenreCounter`. The program processes a library dataset and performs genre-related analysis (e.g., counting occurrences of specific genres). It demonstrates key OS concepts such as file I/O, process management, and MapReduce.

## Features
- Reads input data from a specified library directory or file.
- Analyzes and counts genre occurrences (or other relevant metrics).
- Utilizes system calls for efficient file processing.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Operating System**: Linux/Unix-based system (tested on [e.g., Ubuntu 20.04])
- **Compiler**: GCC or another C/C++ compiler (if applicable)
